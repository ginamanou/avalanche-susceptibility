# Avalanche susceptibility assessment
A collection of python notebooks created during the conduction of an MSc thesis at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

The aim of this research work has been to evaluate the suitability of data-driven models to assess susceptibility and map initiation areas of snow avalanches in Andorra. This aim was formulated as a **classification** task and the **machine learning** algorithms that were brought to the test included the:
- Decision Tree, 
- Random Forest, 
- Adaptive Boosting, 
- Gradient Boosting, 
- Extreme Gradient Boosting, 
- Logistic Regression, 
- Support Vector Classifier, and 
- Neural Network. 

The models received as input topographical information of the study area, derived by GIS analysis of a 5x5 m DEM and a land cover map, interpolated weather station data, snow cover information from Landsat 8 and the susceptibility to shallow landslides acquired by Shalstab.
